@article{Serviere2006,
	abstract = {This paper presents a method for blind separation of convolutive mixtures of speech signals, based on the joint diagonalization of the time varying spectral matrices of the observation records. The main and still largely open problem in a frequency domain approach is permutation ambiguity. In an earlier paper of the authors, the continuity of the frequency response of the unmixing filters is exploited, but it leaves some frequency permutation jumps. This paper therefore proposes a new method based on two assumptions. The frequency continuity of the unmixing filters is still used in the initialization of the diagonalization algorithm. Then, the paper introduces a new method based on the time-frequency representations of the sources. They are assumed to vary smoothly with frequency. This hypothesis of the continuity of the time variation of the source energy is exploited on a sliding frequency bandwidth. It allows us to detect the remaining frequency permutation jumps. The method is compared with other approaches and results on real world recordings demonstrate superior performances of the proposed algorithm},

	abstract = {We present a frequency-domain technique based on PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) analysis that performs multichannel blind source separation (BSS) of convolutive speech mixtures. PARAFAC algorithms are combined with a dimensionality reduction step to significantly reduce computational complexity. The identifiability potential of PARAFAC is exploited to derive a BSS algorithm for the under-determined case (more speakers than microphones), combining PARAFAC analysis with time-varying Capon beamforming. Finally, a low-complexity adaptive version of the BSS algorithm is proposed that can track changes in the mixing environment. Extensive experiments with realistic and measured data corroborate our claims, including the under-determined case. Signal-to-interference ratio improvements of up to 6 dB are shown compared to state-of-the-art BSS algorithms, at an order of magnitude lower computational complexity.},

@article{Pedersen2006,
	abstract = {The main focuses in this thesis are on blind separation of acoustic signals and on a speech enhancement by time-frequency masking. As a part of the thesis, an exhaustive review on existing techniques for blind separation of convolutive acoustic mixtures is provided. A new algorithm is proposed for separation of acoustic signals, where the number of sources in the mixtures exceeds the number of sensors. In order to segregate the sources from the mixtures, this method iteratively combines two techniques: Blind source separation by independent component analysis (ICA) and timefrequency masking. The proposed algorithm has been applied for separation of speech signals as well as stereo music signals. The proposed method uses recordings from two closely-spaced microphones, similar to the microphones used in hearing aids. Besides that, a source separation method known as gradient flow beamforming has been extended in order to cope with convolutive audio mixtures. This method also requires recordings from closely-spaced microphones. Also a theoretical result concerning the convergence in gradient descent independent component analysis algorithms is provided in the thesis.},

@article{Matsuoka2002,
	abstract = { In blind source separation, the number of sensors is usually assumed to be equal to the number of sources. In this case, an indeterminacy appears with which any linear transform of an estimated source signal can also be considered another estimation of the source signal. Moreover, in the case that the number of sensors is greater than the number of sources, another indeterminacy arises due to the redundancy of the sensors. Although these indeterminacies are often considered unsubstantial and have been eliminated without definite bases, an appropriate normalization of the separator is important to enhance the accuracy of the separation result, particularly in the case of a convolutive mixture. The paper shows two principles for eliminating these indeterminacies: (i) minimal distortion principle; (ii) inverse minimal distortion principle.},

@article{Quinlan2007,
	abstract = {High-resolution methods for estimating signal processing parameters such as bearing angles in array processing or frequencies in spectral analysis may be hampered by the model order if poorly selected. As classical model order selection methods fail when the number of snapshots available is small, this paper proposes a method for noncoherent sources, which continues to work under such conditions, while maintaining low computational complexity. For white Gaussian noise and short data we show that the profile of the ordered noise eigenvalues is seen to approximately fit an exponential law. This fact is used to provide a recursive algorithm which detects a mismatch between the observed eigenvalue profile and the theoretical noise-only eigenvalue profile, as such a mismatch indicates the presence of a source. Moreover this proposed method allows the probability of false alarm to be controlled and predefined, which is a crucial point for systems such as RADARs. Results of simulations are provided in order to show the capabilities of the algorithm.},

@article{Parra2000,
	abstract = {Acoustic signals recorded simultaneously in a reverberant
	environment can be described as sums of differently convolved sources.
	The task of source separation is to identify the multiple channels and
	possibly to invert those in order to obtain estimates of the underlying
	sources. We tackle the problem by explicitly exploiting the
	nonstationarity of the acoustic sources. Changing cross correlations at
	multiple times give a sufficient set of constraints for the unknown
	channels. A least squares optimization allows us to estimate a forward
	model, identifying thus the multipath channel. In the same manner we can
	find an FIR backward model, which generates well separated model
	sources. Furthermore, for more than three channels we have sufficient
	conditions to estimate underlying additive sensor noise powers. We show
	the good performance in a real room environments and demonstrate the
	algorithm's utility for automatic speech recognition},

	abstract = {Approximate joint diagonalization of a set of matrices is an
	essential tool in many blind source separation (BSS) algorithms. A
	common measure of the attained diagonalization of the set is the
	weighted least-squares (WLS) criterion. However, most well-known
	algorithms are restricted to finding an orthogonal diagonalizing matrix,
	relying on a whitening phase for the nonorthogonal factor. Often, such
	an approach implies unbalanced weighting, which can result in degraded
	performance. We propose an iterative alternating-directions algorithm
	for minimizing the WLS criterion with respect to a general (not
	necessarily orthogonal) diagonalizing matrix. Under some mild
	assumptions, we prove weak convergence in the sense that the norm of
	parameters update is guaranteed to fall below any arbitrarily small
	threshold within a finite number of iterations. We distinguish between
	Hermitian and symmetrical problems. Using BSS simulations results, we
	demonstrate the improvement in estimating the mixing matrix, resulting
	from the relaxation of the orthogonality restriction},
